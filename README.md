> Vue, Node, Express, qBitorrent

## Installation

- Probably a Docker image but I haven't properly figured out this part yet... 

### Development

FRONTEND : Git clone & npm run serve!

SERVER   : (npm run build, copy dist to server (optional)) & nodemon server.js!

---

## Features
- viewing sessions stats ( down / upload speed, session uploaded / downloaded )
- adding / removing / pausing / resuming torrents
- sorting by every property shown!
- mobile friendly! (maybe not for thousands of torrents...)

## Contributing

I'll gladly accept help & advice! (this is my first project of this nature, pls be kind :P ).

## FAQ

- **Why build this??**
    - Why not? Most WebUI's look very dated and now it's no longer necessary to search for a remote control app!
